E2E ML Project from development to deployment
In this tutorial, we will go through the process of building a simple E2E ML project from
development to deployment. We will use Python as our programming language and TensorFlow as our
machine learning framework.
Step 1: Define the Problem and Requirements
The first step in building an E2E ML project is to define the problem and requirements. This
includes identifying the business problem, gathering data, and defining the performance metrics.
Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
The next step is to collect and preprocess the data. This includes data cleaning, feature scaling,
and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Step 3: Model Development
The third step is to develop the machine learning model. This includes selecting the appropriate
algorithm, training the model, and tuning the hyperparameters.
Step 4: Model Evaluation
The fourth step is to evaluate the performance of the model. This includes calculating the
performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and visualizing the results.
Step 5: Model Deployment
The final step is to deploy the model. This includes creating a production-ready model, deploying it
to a cloud platform, and integrating it with a web application.
Step 6: Model Monitoring and Maintenance
The final step is to monitor and maintain the model. This includes tracking the model's performance,
identifying areas for improvement, and retraining the model as needed.
